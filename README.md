## 🚀 About Me

I’m an **AI enthusiast, builder, and lifelong learner** who’s passionate about creating technology for good. Whether it’s healthcare, sustainability, or education, I’m driven to craft AI-powered solutions that make a real-world impact.

I thrive on translating big ideas into working products—blending **machine learning research, full-stack development, and cloud solutions** into practical tools that help others.  
When I'm not coding, you’ll find me exploring the outdoors, reading about emerging tech, or playing chess.
